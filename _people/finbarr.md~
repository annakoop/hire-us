I am (or was) a Senior Research Engineer at DeepMind, where I've spent the last 5 years studying game theory problems at scale. I was the first engineer DeepMind hired outside of London, so I have experience building teams & trying to cultivate a strong organisational culture. Lately, my research interests have focused on figuring out how we can scale our existing models to use ever more amounts of compute/data. A recent paper that I authored found exploits in AlphaZero by using a custom MCTS variant designed to exploit other agents; we found critical flaws in the way AlphaZero trained. Recently, I have been leading a small team on an extension of that work, which tried to do something similar, by using MuZero to figure out how to trick a large language model into uttering arbitrary text.
